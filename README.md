# Refactor-horiseon

## Initial Project
- Received a completed webpage full of non scemantic code such as div
- Received a webpage without a title
- Received a webpage without alt attributes for the image files


## Changes I made
    
 -   The changes I made were simple, I removed all div tags and replaced them with the proper tags, such as header or section.

 -   Replaced the title with "Horiseon" to match what the webpage was presenting

 -   Added alt attributes for all images for screenreader support.
